# Boundary-flow-induced-membrane-tubulation-under-turgor-pressures
This repository contains MATLAB code for solving the shape equations of membranes. The detailed derivation of the membrane shape equations is thoroughly explained in the associated paper.

Since the initial data is already included in the InitData folder, you can directly run the **findshape.m** file to perform dynamic simulations of the membrane under different parameters.
